#---------- APIs ----------#

# API stands for:
# 	- Application (a piece of software, a computer program, or a server) 
# 	- Programming (what you’re doing with python)
# 	- Interface (how you’re communicating)


# How It Works:
# 	- Every Internet page is stored on a remote server
# 	- When you go to a website, a request goes out to their remote server
# 	- Your browser (the client) receives the response
# 	- When surfing the web, the API is the part of the remote server 
#	  that receives requests and sends responses
# 	- Informative explanation: 
#	  https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-an-api-and-how-does-it-work-1dccd7a8219e

# How Developers Use It: 
# 	- The app’s functionality requires photography (think SnapChat)
# 	- iPhone devs already made camera software & efficient translations of inputs to outputs
# 	- Devs can use that software instead of writing it from scratch! (gains from trade)
# 	- Use the iPhone camera API to embed photography functions in your app
# 	- When Apple upgrades the camera software, your app benefits from the improvements
# 	- Another non-technical explanation: https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/


# How We (social scientists) Use It
# 	- Tools:
#		1 - Google Cloud Speech API
#		2 - Microsoft Azure Emotion API

# 	- Data:
#		1 - Twitter
#		2 - GoogleMaps
#		3 - Census
#		4 - FEC
#		5 - Google Civic API
#		6 - Legislative data (ex. UK and Brazil Parliaments)


# All APIs are different, and each has its own learning curve 
# Some require account keys:
# 	- Keep these private
# Most have request limits
# Some aren’t free
# We’re using python wrappers for APIs
# 	- R also offers API wrappers
# 	- Look for these to ease your coding burden




#---------- Pollster API ----------#
